-> html part of js = jsx (syntax extension) needs to be comiled
-> JSX element treated like js expression, can be saved in variable etc
-> JSX element can have attributes like regular html element
-> jsx elemnts can bes nested - mlti line in brackets !!
-> jsx element: needs one outermost element -> ez: wrap a div around it!
-> render = make it appear on screen
-> ReactDOM.render(element, where)
-> ReactDOM.render only renders changing elements. render twice in a row: second render does nothing
-> big React advantage: sets up virtual dom and changes it -> only changes the real doms elemnts, that got changed in the virtual dom update (dom is slow, updating virtual dom is fast)
-> IN JSX class = className!!!
-> self closing tag? slash has to be put before ending bracket

-> {} for javascript operations inside of jsx expression
-> access js variables inside jsx expressions via {}
-> also works for html attributes inside jsx
-> jsx = working with event listeners a lot
-> in jsx onClick instead of onclick
-> no ifs in jsx {}
-> ternary operator shows up often
-> && shows up often
-> map is important! (var people = ['Rowe', 'Prevost', 'Gare'];

                      var peopleLIs = people.map(function(person){
                        // return statement goes here:
	                      return <li>{person} </li>
                      });

                      // ReactDOM.render goes here:
                       ReactDOM.render(<ul>{peopleLIs}</ul>, document.getElementById('app'))
                       )
-> key is an jsx attribute -> shuffling or memory in lists
